    """
    Manages extraction state persistence and recovery for clinical trials data extraction.

    This stateless utility class handles checkpoint operations using Airflow Variables,
    enabling extraction jobs to resume from their last successful point after failures or retries.
    State is stored per task_id and execution_date combination, ensuring isolation between
    different DAG runs.

    The state includes:
    - last_saved_page: The page number that was successfully saved
    - last_saved_token: The pagination token for the next page
    - next_page_url: The constructed URL for the next API request
    - previous_token: The token used for the current page (for verification)

    Attributes:
        context (Context): Airflow task context containing execution metadata
        execution_date (str): The logical date of the DAG run (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
        log (logging.Logger): Airflow task logger for tracking state operations

        Persist current extraction state to Airflow Variables for retry recovery.

        Saves a checkpoint that allows the extraction process to resume from its current
        position if the task fails or is retried. The checkpoint is stored as a JSON string
        in an Airflow Variable, using a composite key of task_id and execution_date.
